          The segmentation of brain tissues in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for neurodegenerative analysis, facilitating 
          the study of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This project explores several deep learning models, 
          including U-Net, nnU-Net, and LinkNet, for segmenting MRI brain tissues using the IBSR18 dataset. Pretrained weights from ImageNet, such 
          as ResNet 34 and ResNet 50, were utilized as backbones for U-Net and LinkNet to enhance the models' performance and feature extraction 
          capabilities. In addition, statistical method, such as Probabilistic ATLAS, is incorporated for comparison. Performance assessment reveals 
          that 3D nnU-Net excels with an average mean Dice Score of 0.937 ± 0.012. Notably, 2D nnU-Net outperforms in Hausdorff Distance (5.005 ± 0.343) and Absolute Volumetric Difference (3.695 ± 2.931). 
          This comprehensive analysis highlights the unique strengths of each model in different aspects of brain tissue segmentation

          Image registration, essential for both direct diagnosis from aligned images and optimizing algorithmic performance in medical imaging, 
          played a central role in this project. In this project, we utilized inspiratory and expiratory Breath-Hold CT image pairs from the COPDgene 
          study repository, with experimentation focusing on key aspects of the registration framework, including the choice of similarity metric, 
          geometric transformation, interpolation, and resolutions. To reduce variations across images and enhance comparability for easier image 
          registration, we preprocessed intensities. Utilizing Elastix and Transformix computer software, we conducted intensity-based registrations, 
          both rigid and non-rigid, on unsegmented and segmented lung structures. Our approach involved defining a region of interest and excluding 
          non-essential areas. As a result, our method demonstrated an average mean Target Registration Error (TRE) of 2.08 ± 2.26 mm, highlighting 
          the effectiveness of our approach and the fine-tuned parameters. Additionally, using VoxelMorph, we achieved an average mean 
          TRE of 2.18 ± 2.74 mm for the same cases. These findings underscore 
          the success of our methodology in achieving accurate image registration and its potential impact on supporting medical imaging diagnosis.

          In the field of computer vision and medical applications, image segmentation is crucial for developing Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) 
          systems, aiding in early disease detection and clinical treatment planning. Brain tissue segmentation, a challenging task, can be 
          effectively performed using the unsupervised cluster-based Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm combined with a Gaussian Mixture 
          Model (GMM) on MRI data. This approach, encompassing White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) segmentation, 
          employs a Gaussian Probability Distribution for soft assignment, providing probabilities to different clusters within the feature 
          space. Essential pre-processing techniques such as bias field correction and skull stripping enhance segmentation outcomes. The 
          obtained Dice score metrics of (0.86, 0.81, 0.86) for mean and (0.03, 0.03, 0.03) for standard deviation underscore the algorithm's 
          accuracy and consistency, positioning it as a valuable tool in CAD systems for robust disease detection and early clinical intervention.

          Atlas-based segmentation, a fundamental technique in medical imaging, enhances image segmentation precision by leveraging knowledge 
          from annotated reference images or atlases. This project extends beyond segmentation to investigate the impact of image registration 
          techniques, comparing affine (rigid) and bspline (non-rigid) methods. Results indicate that bspline registration outperforms affine
           registration, particularly in terms of mutual information. Integrating this refined alignment into segmentation algorithms, such as 
           the Expectation-Maximization method, yields an overall enhanced performance. The study underscores the significance of atlas-based 
           segmentation coupled with advanced image registration techniques, highlighting the superior efficacy of bspline (non-rigid) 
           registration for improved brain tissue segmentation.

          Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent form of cancer affecting women worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer-related 
          mortality. Early detection plays a pivotal role in reducing mortality rates and expanding treatment options. This project focuses on 
          the development of an advanced system for the early detection and segmentation of breast masses in mammograms, leveraging a computer-
          aided diagnosis (CAD) approach. Mammography, recognized as a highly efficient primary screening tool, is crucial for detecting 
          features such as masses and microcalcifications indicative of breast cancer. However, identifying irregularly shaped masses with 
          low contrast poses a significant challenge. To address this, our proposed approach employs a five-step process for mass detection 
          and segmentation. These steps include pre-processing, multi-scale morphological sifting for region candidate generation, mean-shift 
          filtering, k-means clustering, and post-processing. To enhance accuracy, we integrated the ucasML tool for obtaining classification
           scores, incorporating a feature extraction process and detailed evaluation methods. The classifier, trained on the extracted features,
            demonstrated impressive results with an accuracy of 96.96%, specificity of 95.55%, and sensitivity of 95.53%.

            Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, powered by machine learning and deep learning techniques, present a promising avenue to 
            enhance the accuracy of skin lesion detection in medical images. In this project, we aim to contribute to the field by developing 
            an efficient CAD system capable of assisting medical professionals in diagnosing skin cancer. This project pioneers the integration
             of machine learning and deep learning techniques for the critical task of skin lesion detection in medical images, with a primary
            focus on advancing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for precise skin cancer diagnosis. Employing a two-step hierarchal 
            classification pipeline discerning "benign vs. others" and "melanoma vs. seborrheic keratosis," our hybrid model, merging Xception
            and Random Forest, achieves an impressive Balanced Multiclass Accuracy (BMA) score of 79%. This surpasses the performance of 
            established architectures like VGG16, InceptionResNetv2, and DenseNet201. Beyond showcasing the potential for machine learning 
            in elevating skin cancer diagnostic accuracy, this research underscores the broader applicability of CAD systems in addressing
            crucial challenges in medical image analysis, particularly in the realm of skin cancer detection.

          This project details the design and implementation of an Inverse Kinematic Controller for the JACO2 robot, focusing on achieving precise 
          end-effector positioning in three distinct scenarios. The primary objective is to control the robot to follow a vertical line trajectory 
          along the z-axis within a 2-second duration. Additionally, the controller guides the robot through a position-only control scenario,
           traversing a vertical square path along the yz-axis. Each side of the square is executed with a 2-second trajectory, including 500 ms 
           pauses at corners and a 2-second hold at the initial end-effector position upon completion. The third scenario involves both position
            and orientation control, where the end-effector follows the square trajectory while maintaining a constant orientation. The MATLAB-based 
            implementation employs a 1 ms sampling time, quaternions for orientation feedback, and visualizes the trajectory, joint positions, and
             velocities. 
          Successful execution of the specified scenarios demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed Inverse Kinematic Controller.

        <h2>A Comparative Study of Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation Techniques from MRI</h2>
        <div class="presentation-images brain_em-image">
        </div>
        <p>
          Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images are widely used to identify brain tumors such as meningioma and glioma. Gliomas are the most 
          life-threatening brain tumors because of their rapid growth and effect on the function of the brain. However, early detection and 
          appropriate diagnosis of the brain tumor can reduce the chance of death [1]. Manual segmentation requires an expert and more time to
           identify and classify brain tumors even sometimes it provides an inaccurate result. Brain tumor segmentation from MRI images using 
           computer-aided diagnosis is a fast, automatic, and advanced technique, but it is also a challenging task due to the non-uniform shape 
           and size, and the spread boundaries of tumors within the surrounding area. This article aims to make a comparative study between the 
          traditional segmentation techniques and segmentation using deep learning approaches as well as find out their positive aspects and
           limitations.

          Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness,
           and difficulty with balance and coordination. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals may faithfully represent the changes that occur
            during PD in the brain. Therefore, EEG signals are required to decompose into multiple sub-bands (SBs) to get detailed and 
            representative information from it. Hence, An automated tunable Q wavelet transform (A-TQWT) is proposed for automatic decomposition.
             A-TQWT extracts representative SBs for analysis and provides better reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by 
             automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features are extracted from the SBs and classified different machine
              learning techniques. The proposed method yielded an accuracy of 96.13% and 97.65% while the area under the curve of 97% and
               98.56% for the classification of HC vs PD (OFF medication) and HC vs PD (ON medication) using least square support vector
                machine, respectively.
