          Skin lesions pose a significant risk due to their potential to manifest as malignant tumors. Early diagnosis plays a pivotal 
          role in effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Leveraging computer-aided diagnosis systems can revolutionize this
           process by enhancing accuracy and speed. This project aimed to develop a robust skin lesion classification model using machine
            learning. The pipeline encompassed image preprocessing, augmentation, feature extraction, feature engineering, and a machine 
            learning classifier. Employing a mixed dataset comprising HAM10000(ViDIR Group, Medical University of Vienna), the BCN_20000 
            (Hospital ClÃ­nic de Barcelona) and the MSK Dataset (ISBI 2017), the binary classification achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.85, 
            while the multiclass classification yielded a kappa score of 0.74 on the test data. These promising results underscore the potential of 
          machine learning in aiding dermatologists and healthcare professionals in accurate and timely skin lesion diagnoses.

          In the field of computer vision and medical applications, image segmentation is crucial for developing Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) 
          systems, aiding in early disease detection and clinical treatment planning. Brain tissue segmentation, a challenging task, can be 
          effectively performed using the unsupervised cluster-based Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm combined with a Gaussian Mixture 
          Model (GMM) on MRI data. This approach, encompassing White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) segmentation, 
          employs a Gaussian Probability Distribution for soft assignment, providing probabilities to different clusters within the feature 
          space. Essential pre-processing techniques such as bias field correction and skull stripping enhance segmentation outcomes. The 
          obtained Dice score metrics of (0.86, 0.81, 0.86) for mean and (0.03, 0.03, 0.03) for standard deviation underscore the algorithm's 
          accuracy and consistency, positioning it as a valuable tool in CAD systems for robust disease detection and early clinical intervention.

          Atlas-based segmentation, a fundamental technique in medical imaging, enhances image segmentation precision by leveraging knowledge 
          from annotated reference images or atlases. This project extends beyond segmentation to investigate the impact of image registration 
          techniques, comparing affine (rigid) and bspline (non-rigid) methods. Results indicate that bspline registration outperforms affine
           registration, particularly in terms of mutual information. Integrating this refined alignment into segmentation algorithms, such as 
           the Expectation-Maximization method, yields an overall enhanced performance. The study underscores the significance of atlas-based 
           segmentation coupled with advanced image registration techniques, highlighting the superior efficacy of bspline (non-rigid) 
           registration for improved brain tissue segmentation.

          Breast cancer stands as the most prevalent form of cancer affecting women worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer-related 
          mortality. Early detection plays a pivotal role in reducing mortality rates and expanding treatment options. This project focuses on 
          the development of an advanced system for the early detection and segmentation of breast masses in mammograms, leveraging a computer-
          aided diagnosis (CAD) approach. Mammography, recognized as a highly efficient primary screening tool, is crucial for detecting 
          features such as masses and microcalcifications indicative of breast cancer. However, identifying irregularly shaped masses with 
          low contrast poses a significant challenge. To address this, our proposed approach employs a five-step process for mass detection 
          and segmentation. These steps include pre-processing, multi-scale morphological sifting for region candidate generation, mean-shift 
          filtering, k-means clustering, and post-processing. To enhance accuracy, we integrated the ucasML tool for obtaining classification
           scores, incorporating a feature extraction process and detailed evaluation methods. The classifier, trained on the extracted features,
            demonstrated impressive results with an accuracy of 96.96%, specificity of 95.55%, and sensitivity of 95.53%.

            Skin cancer is a prevalent and concerning health issue, necessitating advanced diagnostic tools for early detection. 
            Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, powered by machine learning and deep learning techniques, present a promising avenue to 
            enhance the accuracy of skin lesion detection in medical images. In this project, we aim to contribute to the field by developing 
            an efficient CAD system capable of assisting medical professionals in diagnosing skin cancer. This project pioneers the integration
             of machine learning and deep learning techniques for the critical task of skin lesion detection in medical images, with a primary
            focus on advancing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for precise skin cancer diagnosis. Employing a two-step hierarchal 
            classification pipeline discerning "benign vs. others" and "melanoma vs. seborrheic keratosis," our hybrid model, merging Xception
            and Random Forest, achieves an impressive Balanced Multiclass Accuracy (BMA) score of 79%. This surpasses the performance of 
            established architectures like VGG16, InceptionResNetv2, and DenseNet201. Beyond showcasing the potential for machine learning 
            in elevating skin cancer diagnostic accuracy, this research underscores the broader applicability of CAD systems in addressing
            crucial challenges in medical image analysis, particularly in the realm of skin cancer detection.

          This study addresses Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification using MRI and gene expression data through three binary classification
           problems: AD vs. Control (CTL), AD vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and MCI vs. CTL. Employing feature engineering and machine 
           learning, we developed a classification algorithm for each problem. The Boruta feature selection algorithm combined with Quadratic
            Discriminative Analysis (QDA) consistently outperformed other approaches, yielding the highest AUC (0.963) and MCC (0.927) for AD

          This project presents the implementation and evaluation of the Regularized General Eigenvalue Classifier (ReGEC) using the R programming 
          language. Employing the generalized eigenvalue problem with regularization, ReGEC demonstrates versatility in computer vision, speech 
          recognition, and bioinformatics. Utilizing four datasetsâ€”Cleveland Heart, Pima Indians, Breast Cancer, and Germanâ€”the study applies Linear 
          Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction. Results show a classification accuracy of 86.67% and 77.91% for linear and Gaussian 
          kernels, respectively. Performance metrics encompassing 
          classification accuracy and execution time highlight ReGEC's efficacy in classification tasks, emphasizing its successful implementation in R.

          This project details the design and implementation of an Inverse Kinematic Controller for the JACO2 robot, focusing on achieving precise 
          end-effector positioning in three distinct scenarios. The primary objective is to control the robot to follow a vertical line trajectory 
          along the z-axis within a 2-second duration. Additionally, the controller guides the robot through a position-only control scenario,
           traversing a vertical square path along the yz-axis. Each side of the square is executed with a 2-second trajectory, including 500 ms 
           pauses at corners and a 2-second hold at the initial end-effector position upon completion. The third scenario involves both position
            and orientation control, where the end-effector follows the square trajectory while maintaining a constant orientation. The MATLAB-based 
            implementation employs a 1 ms sampling time, quaternions for orientation feedback, and visualizes the trajectory, joint positions, and
             velocities. 
          Successful execution of the specified scenarios demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed Inverse Kinematic Controller.

        <h2>A Comparative Study of Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation Techniques from MRI</h2>
        <div class="presentation-images brain_em-image">
        </div>
        <p>
          Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images are widely used to identify brain tumors such as meningioma and glioma. Gliomas are the most 
          life-threatening brain tumors because of their rapid growth and effect on the function of the brain. However, early detection and 
          appropriate diagnosis of the brain tumor can reduce the chance of death [1]. Manual segmentation requires an expert and more time to
           identify and classify brain tumors even sometimes it provides an inaccurate result. Brain tumor segmentation from MRI images using 
           computer-aided diagnosis is a fast, automatic, and advanced technique, but it is also a challenging task due to the non-uniform shape 
           and size, and the spread boundaries of tumors within the surrounding area. This article aims to make a comparative study between the 
          traditional segmentation techniques and segmentation using deep learning approaches as well as find out their positive aspects and
           limitations.

        <h2>Detection of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Using Automated Tunable Q Wavelet Transform Technique with EEG Signals

          Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness,
           and difficulty with balance and coordination. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals may faithfully represent the changes that occur
            during PD in the brain. Therefore, EEG signals are required to decompose into multiple sub-bands (SBs) to get detailed and 
            representative information from it. Hence, An automated tunable Q wavelet transform (A-TQWT) is proposed for automatic decomposition.
             A-TQWT extracts representative SBs for analysis and provides better reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by 
             automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features are extracted from the SBs and classified different machine
              learning techniques. The proposed method yielded an accuracy of 96.13% and 97.65% while the area under the curve of 97% and
               98.56% for the classification of HC vs PD (OFF medication) and HC vs PD (ON medication) using least square support vector
                machine, respectively.

          Brain
          Tumors are the leading cause of cancer death in
          children They are caused by the abnormal and
          uncontrolled growth of cells inside the brain or spinal
          canal Classification of brain tumors using machine
          learning technology is very relevant for radiologists to
          confirm their analysis more effectively and quickly
          Segmentation algorithm identified for detecting the tumor
          from the MRI brain scans need to detect shapeless tumor
          growth perfectly Sobel edge detection is one of the
          widely used edge detection techniques in which only
          information along horizontal and vertical directions are
          considered In this research, Sobel algorithm with 8
          directional template is implemented for improving the
          detection of edges in brain tumor MRI images The
          proposed algorithm is compared with other traditional
          edge detection algorithms The performance of the
          proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of MSE, RMSE,
          Entropy, SNR and PSNR Analysis shows that 8 Sobel is
          comparatively the most suitable technique for analyzing
          brain tumor MRI images Active contouring segmentation
          algorithm is applied on the edge detected images to
          verify the classification accuracy of segmented tumor.
